    <h2>Code Geass</h2>
    <p>My favorite anime series. It has everything a good anime should: super coloristic MC, great plot, beautiful animation, mechs and much much more.</p>
    <h2>Inglourious Basterds</h2>
    <p>I really love all the Quentin Tarantino movies and it's hard to choose the only one of them. But for some reason this one touches me more than others. I don't actually now why it's so.</p>
    <h2>The Green Book</h2>
    <p>I was attending my middle school when i wathced this wonderful movie for the first time in my life. And the way i was impressed by it can't be described in words (Honestly, I just don't know English good enough).</p>
